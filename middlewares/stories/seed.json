Some were familiar – advertisements for European imported items the likes of which I had seen in supermarkets around the city: Staedtler pencils, Nestle coffee, Horlick’s malted milk.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Many artists draw inspiration from many aspects of their life.</p></p> In addition, their view of the time period they’re in and about is infused into their art. What they see, hear and think about – all part of his world – show up in the colours, the medium, and the perspectives they choose. Emily Bronte may have penned “Wuthering Heights” from the comforts of her own home, hardly having any contact with the outside world, but in an accelerated time like today, no one really lives in a vacuum anymore; so the experiences the artist lives through are necessarily part of whatever they create.</p>"
